// Provides metadata pertaining to initial cluster discovery. It is the
// entrypoint into the steps to join a cluster.
//
// Node ID assignment and joining a cluster
// ========================================
// When a node starts up, before it can initialize most of its subsystems, it
// must be made aware of its node ID. It can either get this from its config,
// the kv-store, or be assigned one by the controller leader. In all cases, the
// node ID and node UUID must be registered with the controller, after which
// the node can proceed join the cluster.
//
// The high level steps are as follows:
//
// When the node ID is unknown:
// 1. Generate or load node UUID
// 2. Get assigned a node ID by sending a request to the controller leader
// 3. Start subsystems with our known node ID
// 4. Join the cluster and get added to the controller Raft group by sending a
//    request to the controller leader
// 5. Once added to the cluster, open endpoints for user traffic
//
// When the node ID is known:
// 1. Generate or load node UUID
// 2. Load node ID from config or kv-store
// 3. Start subsystems with our known node ID
// 4. Register our UUID with our node ID and join the cluster by sending a
//    request to the controller leader
// 5. Once added to the cluster, open endpoints for user traffic
//
// These steps are implemented here, in redpanda/application.cc, and in
// cluster/members_manager.cc
//
// TODO: reconcile the RPC dispatch logic here with that in members_manager.

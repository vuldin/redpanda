/// max_attempts. The replication result is returned to the caller, which
/// decides whether a failure is fatal -- the call is not fire-and-forget.
///
/// While the tiered_cloud_topics feature is not active (the cluster is not
/// fully upgraded to v26.2) every notification attempt is a no-op that
/// reports success. The gate is not hypothetical: storage.mode=cloud topics
/// may exist during the upgrade (only tiered_cloud creation is blocked) and
/// L1 compaction of a cloud topic hands the notifier a new floor like any
/// other, so without the gate the set_min_allowed_local_threshold stm
/// command would be replicated to pre-v26.2 replicas that cannot apply it.
/// Skipping the floor update is safe in the meantime: cloud-mode reads are
/// routed through the last reconciled offset rather than the floor, and no
/// tiered_cloud topic (the only reader of local data below the floor) can
/// exist until the feature is active.
